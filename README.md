# Transportation Management System (TMS) - MVP

## Project Overview
This is a custom Transportation Management System (TMS) designed and developed from scratch as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The primary purpose is to manage the core operations of a small to medium-sized dispatching company, with an emphasis on ease of use, scalability, and cost-efficiency. This project demonstrates my ability to handle full-stack development, API integrations, and scalable system design. It is also intended to showcase my problem-solving skills and capability to deliver end-to-end solutions as a junior developer.

## Current Features
### Core Functionalities
- **CRM Integration:** Automated sales pipeline onboarding and paperwork using CRM tools.
- **Automated Carrier Packets:** Streamlined broker onboarding with auto-generated packets.
- **Load Management:**
  - Create, assign, and track loads.
  - Manage load statuses (e.g., pending, in-progress, completed).
  - Filter and search for loads based on destination, status, and date.

- **Driver and Truck Management:**
  - Assign drivers and trucks to specific loads.
  - Track driver availability and vehicle status.
  - Basic compliance management (e.g., Hours of Service tracking).

- **Dispatch Dashboard:**
  - Interactive UI with a map-centered view for load tracking and routing.
  - Real-time updates for load status changes.

- **Basic Reporting and Invoicing:**
  - Generate invoices for completed loads.
  - Basic financial reporting tools for revenue tracking.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js with TypeScript for dynamic and scalable UI components.
- **Backend:** Node.js as the primary backend language for high-performance APIs and real-time communication, with **Django** used for authentication, admin dashboard, and other built-in utilities.
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data management and scalability.
- **Mapping and Geospatial Tools:** Leaflet.js integrated with OpenStreetMap for interactive mapping and load tracking.
- **Hosting and Deployment:** Hosted on **Hetzner VPS** for cost-effective scalability, using Docker for containerization and CI/CD pipelines.


### Phase 1: Advanced Features (Next 6 Months)
- **CRM Integration:** Automated sales pipeline onboarding and paperwork using CRM tools.

- **Automated Carrier Packets:** Streamlined broker onboarding with auto-generated packets.
  
- **Load Board Integration:**
  - Connect to popular load boards (e.g., DAT, Truckstop) for seamless load matching.
  - Automate load recommendations based on historical data.
    
- **Real-Time GPS Tracking:**
  - Integrate with third-party APIs for live GPS tracking.
  - Implement WebSocket-based updates for real-time location.

- **User Role Management:**
  - Implement multi-user roles (Admin, Dispatcher, Driver) with custom permissions.

### Phase 2: Scalability and Enterprise Features (6-12 Months)
- **Multi-Tenancy Support:**
  - Expand system architecture to support multiple companies with isolated data environments.

- **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:**
  - Develop comprehensive dashboards with KPI tracking, profitability analysis, and operational insights.

- **Route Optimization and Geofencing:**
  - Implement route optimization using OpenRouteService or GraphHopper APIs.
  - Add geofencing alerts for operational efficiency and compliance.
